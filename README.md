kernelstein
===========

It's a repository containing low-level code that was meant to become a microkernel at some point in the past. Until I find the time to come back to it and maybe do a Haskell/C++ hybrid, you're most likely to benefit from low-level C++ ABI integration implemented here, if you're new to it.
